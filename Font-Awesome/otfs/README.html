<ul>
<li><p>We currently recommend using the Duotone-specific optimized .svg vector<br>files. These can be found in the /svgs/duotone folder of this download.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using Ligatures with Duotone Icons is NOT currently recommended - while we’ve<br>included a Duotone ligature-based font file in our Pro desktop download, we<br>can’t recommend it as a way to use our icons on the desktop. Read the special<br>instructions for using duotones with ligatures here -<br><a href="https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/referencing-icons/duotone-icons#using-ligatures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/referencing-icons/duotone-icons#using-ligatures</a>.</p>

<p>You can read the nitty gritty on the current limitations desktop apps have that<br>made our Duotone ligature implementation diferent there as well. And our full<br>Duotone Desktop docs are available at:</p>
